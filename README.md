### Hello World, I'm Netto.  
I love science, technology, and programming. 
I love to solve challenges and learn new things.  
### ðŸ’»  Languages and tools I've used:  
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-000000?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-000000?style=flat&logo=java)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-000000?style=flat&logo=C-Sharp)

in C++ I made some unfinished games and some simple hacks for desktop apps.  
In java, I did some desktop and android apps.  
Some of them are available as repositories here in github and most of them have a wiki with documentation. 
I used c# mostly to play around with Unity

### :calendar:: What I'm currently doing:   
:mortar_board:  I study Control and Automation Engineering at UFSC (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) 

:star: As you can see, Iâ€™m still at the beginning of my journey, I have little experience and I still have a lot to learn.
You can count on me to solve any problem, we can solve the biggest problems if we break them down into smaller problems and manage them in the right way.  
Programming is our best tool to achieve that!
